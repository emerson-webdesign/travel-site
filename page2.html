        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Fuji">Mount Fuji-1</a>
        
        <p>Without a doubt Japan's most recognizable landmark, majestic Mount Fuji (Fuji-san) is also the country's highest mountain peak. Towering 3,776 meters over an otherwise largely flat landscape to the south and east, this majestic and fabled mountain is tall enough to be seen from Tokyo, more than 100 kilometers away.

Mount Fuji has for centuries been celebrated in art and literature and is now considered so important an icon that UNESCO recognized its world cultural significance in 2013. Part of the Fuji-Hakone-Izu National Park, Mount Fuji is climbed by more than a million people each summer as an act of pilgrimage, which culminates in watching the sunrise from its summit.

While some still choose to begin their climb from the base, the majority of climbers now start from above the halfway mark, at the 5th Station, resulting in a more manageable six-or-so-hour ascent. Those who do attempt the complete climb are advised to depart in the afternoon, breaking up the climb with an overnight stop at one of the "Mountain Huts" designed for this very purpose. An early start the next day gets you to the top for the sunrise.

        <p>Located at the foot of the “Storm Mountains” in the north of the city of Kyoto, this world-famous, seemingly endless forest of swaying bamboo boughs is perfect for a relaxing retreat to nature during a stay in Japan.

The Arashiyama bamboo grove is open 24/7 and admission is free. The surrounding Arashiyama district, known for unique fishing methods which involve using trained cormorant birds, is also well worth a visit.


Its main street and Togetsu-kyo Bridge have been called a “tourist circus,” but beyond this thoroughfare, Arashiyama offers an authentic and unforgettable Japanese experience. Read on to discover how the bamboo forest is just the beginning.

This sightseeing district makes for an incredible day trip from Kyoto. From lush forests to cherry blossoms to vibrant autumn koyo colors, Arashiyama is a visual delight.

        <a href="https://www.neverendingvoyage.com/best-places-to-visit-in-japan/">Tokyo-2</a>
        
        
        <p>If Kyoto is the heart of traditional Japan, Tokyo is its ultramodern counterpart.

It’s here you’ll find the skyscrapers, noisy arcades, busy pedestrian crossings, quirky youth fashions, and many many incredibly delicious restaurants.

If all you do in Tokyo is eat, you’ll have an amazing time—even as vegetarians we ate so well.

Tokyo is also home to some of the weirdest activities we’ve ever done. From themed cafes (cats, owls, maids, robots, goats—you name it, Tokyo has it) to sensory-overload shows and arcades to cos-play go-karting.

On my first trip to Tokyo I was overwhelmed by the sprawling city and couldn’t help comparing it unfavourably to Kyoto.

On repeat visits I’ve grown to love the city (the food certainly helped) and while it isn’t as attractive as Kyoto, there is so much to do that you won’t want to skip it.

In Tokyo don’t miss:

Driving a go-kart on the real roads while dressed as your favourite character. Insanity but so much fun!
Eating in a tiny restaurant on atmospheric Memory Lane.
Gazing at the night skyline from the free Tokyo Metropolitan Government Building in Shinjuku.
Walking across the famous Shibuya Crossing.
Gawping at the outrageous outfits on Takeshita Street in Harajuku.
Visiting the brilliant DisneySea (possibly our favourite Disney park in the world!) or neighbouring Tokyo Disneyland (or both if you have two days spare).
Immersing yourself in the colourful digital art museum, TeamLab Planets.
How Long to Spend: 3 – 5 nights or longer if you want to take day trips (such as to Nikko, Kawaguchiko or Hakone (for Mt Fuji), and Kamakura). We’ve spent over a month here on various trips and still find new things to do. If time is limited, I would allocate more time to Kyoto than Tokyo. </p>

        <a href="https://www.neverendingvoyage.com/best-places-to-visit-in-japan/">Osaka-4</a>
        
        <p>Osaka is a Japan must-see for many visitors. We love the neon craziness of Dotonburi, the amazing food (for vegetarians too), friendly people, affordable prices, and the scary rides and brilliant Harry Potter World at Universal Studios Japan. 

But, if you have limited time on your first trip to Japan, I would probably say choose Osaka or Tokyo as they are both sprawling modern cities. 

If you are flying into or out of Kansai airport then it makes sense to spend a night or two in Osaka. You could also visit as a day trip from Kyoto. 

In Osaka, we loved staying in Shinsaibashi. The location is ideal—quiet but close to lots of cool shops and restaurants and within walking distance of Dotonburi. Hotel options include the stylish Hotel The Flag.</p>
